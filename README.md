    Project Title 
FAKE NEWS DETECTION 
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically detect fake news articles based on their content. With the growing spread of misinformation online, especially through social media, it's crucial to develop tools that help identify unreliable or deceptive information.
ABOUT PROJECT
A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.
